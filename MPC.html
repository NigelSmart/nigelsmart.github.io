<h1>MPC and FHE Resources</h1>

In 2011-12 I a ran an advanced graduate course on 
<ul>
<li><a href="FHE-MPC/">FHE and MPC</a>
</ul>
A more modern set of lectures I gave in Bertinoro in August 2018
<ul>
<li><a href="FHE-MPC/Yao.pdf">Yao Based MPC</a>
<li><a href="FHE-MPC/LSSS-MPC.pdf">LSSS Based MPC</a>
</ul>


<p>
My group developed the SCALE-MAMBA software system for MPC
<ul>
<li><a href="SCALE/">SCALE-MAMBA MPC Software</a>.
</ul>
The development of SCALE-MAMBA has now stopped.

<p>
The SCALE-MAMBA system supportted a different format for circuit
descriptions for internal use (we did not allow 
users to define their own circuits within the MPC system) than
the older Bristol-Format circuits.
The newer circuit format can be found, along with some circuit examples,
at the following location:
<ul>
<li><a href="MPC-Circuits">Bristol Fashion Circuits</a>.
</ul>

<p>
We produced a set of videos introducing MPC techniques to support the understanding
of how SCALE-MAMBA worked:

Computing on Encrypted Data Course</a>
</ul>

<p>
I was the co-founder of a company called <b>Unbound Security</b> that was involved in 
applying secure computation to the critical problem securing cryptographic keys. 
In December 2021 Unbound Security was purchased by Coinbase.
