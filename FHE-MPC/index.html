<h1>FHE-MPC Advanced Grad Course</h1>
I (and eventually hopefully others) will be giving an 
`informal grad course' in Fully Homomorphic Encryption and 
Multi-Party Computation this
term (and maybe beyond). This is primarily for the benefit of
the new PhD students starting in this area, but anyone is welcome.
As its aimed at new PhD students we will start at the very
beginning.
<p>

We aim to meet on Mondays at 14.00 in the CAT room starting
on October 10th. Sessions will sometimes be one hour and
sometimes two hours. Initially only one hour to get things
moving (as apparently I am giving the first Crypto lecture
on the 10th).
<p>

My aim is to run this on the US model with scribes etc providing
notes each week for public consumption; but maybe that will need
to stop if we get ahead of the publicly available information on
the topic.
<p>

My draft plan is to cover the following topics in order (to start
with). No idea how long the following will take.
<p>

<b>Part 1: FHE Basics</b>
<ul>
  <li>Lattices. The LLL & BKZ algorithms.
       <ul> Hermite factors</ul>
  <li> LWE. The problem. Why its about lattices. Parameter setting
       <ul> Basically the Micciancio/Regev paper</ul>
  <li> Cyclotomic number fields
	<ul> Algebraic number theory in general really.</ul>
  <li> Gentry/Smart-Vercauteren/BV SHE
  <li> Bootstrapping and FHE
</ul>

<b>Part 2: MPC Basics</b>
<ul>
  <li> Yao 2-Party Protocols
  <li> Shamir and passively secure multi-party protocols.
      <ul> Multiplicative secret sharing. Beaver's trick</ul>
  <li> Online/Offline protocols (VIFF like, BDOZ etc)
      <ul> Actively secure protocols.</ul>
</ul>

Anyway feel free to come along if you are vaguely interested. 

<h2>Scribe Notes</h2>
The idea behind scribe notes is one audience member writes up
the lecture each week for the benefit of the others. They
should not only take the details from the lecture, but also
from other reading etc.
For a good example of this practice see 
<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/gradcrypto2/scribes.html">
here</a> or
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~rashid/395Tcrypt/index.htm">
here</a>.
<p>

You should use the following <a href="template.tex">LaTeX template</a>
to base your notes on. 
Once completed send me the final tex file and pdf and I will put
them below.
