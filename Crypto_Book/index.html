<h1>Cryptography, An Introduction : Third Edition</h1>

The third edition is now online.
You may make copies and distribute the copies of the
book as you see fit, as long as it is clearly marked as having
been authored by N.P. Smart.  <p>

We give a numbering system to present versions.


<ul>
 <li>The first number presents the edition number
 <li>The second number represents a correction which is major, i.e.
     something absolutely crucial has been corrected.
 <li>The third number represents a minor change, e.g. small addition etc.
 <li>The fourth number represents a very minor correction (spelling etc).
</ul>

The current number is <b>3.0.1.3</b> : <a href="book.ps">book.ps</a> and
                                       <a href="book.ps.gz">book.ps.gz</a>.

<p>

<font color="yellow"><h3>Note:</h3></font>
As of May 19th 2016 I will no longer be updating this book with corrections for this
book. 
Readers should instead purchase the book <a href="../errata.html">Cryptography Made Simple</a>.
